Currently building awesome things at Asceoft Inc., where I specialize in creating engaging front-end experiences.

### Frontend
- **React & Next.js** - my primary solution for client and server side rendering
- **Vue.js** - good enough to code in
- **Svelte** - prefer this over vue

### Backend
- **Node.js**
  - Express.js - Building robust REST APIs and web applications
  - Hono - Creating efficient, type-safe backend services
- **PHP**
  - Laravel - Building robust backend systems
  - Lumen - For lightweight microservices
- **Inertia.js** - for bridging the gap between Laravel and javascript frontend frameworks

## ðŸš€ What I Do

I'm passionate about creating seamless user experiences by leveraging modern web technologies. While I'm primarily focused on frontend development, I enjoy working across the full stack to deliver complete solutions.

### My Development Philosophy
